Project descriptionWe tried to accomplish a 2-D strain imaging technique based on calculating a cost function using dynamic programming (DP) method. For this, we first started by the 1-D DP approach. We used the sets of pre-compression and post-compression images. We considered the tissue deformation to be in the axial direction only for a single dimension. We then calculated the cost function as described in the paper. We finally calculated a displacement map of the post-compression image with respect to the pre-compression image. After that, we wrote a strain function to calculate the gradient of the displacement map. This generated the strain image. We could see clearly the tumor
